            — or to download a malicious file that will install viruses on their computer or phone.

            Spoofing is a technique through which a cybercriminal disguises themselves as a known or trusted source. 
            In so doing, the adversary is able to engage with the target and access their systems or devices with the
             ultimate goal of stealing information, extorting money or installing malware or other harmful software 
             on the device.

            Identity-driven attacks are extremely hard to detect. When a valid user’s credentials have been compromised 
            and an adversary is masquerading as that user, it is often very difficult to differentiate between the user’s
             typical behavior and that of the hacker using traditional security measures and tools.

            A supply chain attack is a type of cyberattack that targets a trusted third-party vendor who offers 
            services or software vital to the supply chain. Software supply chain attacks inject malicious code 
            into an application in order to infect all users of an app, while hardware supply chain attacks 
            compromise physical components for the same purpose. Software supply chains are particularly vulnerable
             because modern software is not written from scratch: rather, it involves many off-the-shelf components,
              such as third-party APIs, open source code and proprietary code from software vendors.

            Once infected, the hacker can freely engage in command-and-control activities. This tunnel gives the hacker 
            a route to unleash malware and/or to extract data, IP or other sensitive information by encoding it bit by
             bit in a series of DNS responses.
